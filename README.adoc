= Chats Admin Application

'''
== Introduction

To start a brief introduction, before getting into details below: The Lifeline Chats Program aims to improve the well-being of elderly people in Tasmania by encouraging them to become more socially engaged, through the organising of Chats [underline]#activities# and then by enabling the participation of clients in those activities through organised transportation. 

This Chats Application (App) allows activities to be defined, and Chats [underline]#participants# to be booked for future activities. A key aspect of such participation is that some participant's transportation to and from the activity needs to be arranged, the Chats App enables that administrative action.

An aspect of the Chats program is that some of the activities are regular. These are referred to as [underline]#recurring activities#. A participant booked against a recurring activity intends to participate in the individual (actual) activies of that recurring activity.

Social engagement is also assisted by means of regular telephone calls to Chats participants. Chats [underline]#calls# are scheduled and then completed when a telephone call is made. Often these calls are made by a Chats [underline]#volunteer#.

There is also reporting functionality that the Chat App provides. 

== Implementation

This application has been developed for Lifeline Tasmania for data management in its https://www.lifeline.org.au/tasmania/chats-program[Chats] social engagement program. 

It is a application developed on the open-source http://isis.apache.org/[Apache Isis] Java web-application framework.

For installation details see <<Installation,below>>.

Version 2 of Chats App, based on a generic https://github.com/Stephen-Cameron-Data-Services/event-schedule[event-scheduling] app, is https://github.com/Stephen-Cameron-Data-Services/isis-chats/tree/chats2[available] but not as yet in use.

== Chats Application (App) Basics

The Chats App has a conventional layout with menu bar across the top with a single row of menu items. Clicking on each of these gives a drop-down list of options each of which is described in sections below. These options in some cases are grouped into logical groupings via a dividing line.

On the left hand side of the menu bar is a small vertical bar (aqua blue in the following image). Clicking on this bar gives a list of bookmarks, which are links to entities that the user has prevously visited in the current session.

The top-left 'Chats App' text is a hyperlink back to the 'home' page.

Underneath the menu bar is the body of the page, where, usually, a specific Chats data 'entity' is displayed. Each with an icon and title at the top, and then groups of data items and/or tables of child entities. Each such group and table also has a title at the top. The arrangement of items within groups, and column orders within tables, is called the 'page layout'. 

On some types of entities, tabs are used to aid navigation within an entity. The tab labels are diplayed as a row under the entity title, clicking on a tab label reveals a different subset of the entities' data.

Navigation in Chats App is via links and icons (both are hyperlinks). A link is seen as underlined (light-blue) text. Specific icons are used to represent different kinds or 'types' of data entities so providing a visual cue. Icon hyperlinks are displayed on the left of all table rows to allow the user to 'drill down' to get a full display of the child data entity (partially displayed in the row).

== Chats Data Entities

The following Chats data-model entities are described in sections below:

* <<Activities, Activities>>
** <<One-offActivities, One-off Activities>>
** <<RecurringActivities, Recurring Activities>>
* <<Participants, Participants>>
** <<Participation, Participation>>
** <<Attendance, Attendance>>
* <<Volunteers, Volunteers>>
* <<ChatsCalls, Chats Calls>>

[#Activities]
=== Activities

Activities are scheduled by Chats Administrators in the Chats App. There are two ways to create an Activity, either as a [underline]#One-off Activity# or by first creating a [underline]#Recurring Activity# as a 'parent' and then by scheduling 'child' activities off that parent.

When looking at a list of activities from a search, both the one-off and child activities are seen, as they are basically the same, but have a slightly different icon, more details below.
