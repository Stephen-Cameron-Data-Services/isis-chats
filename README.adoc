[#Introduction]
== Introduction

To start a brief introduction, before getting into details below: The Lifeline Chats Program aims to 
improve the well-being of elderly people in Tasmania by encouraging them to become more socially 
engaged, through the organising of Chats [underline]#activities#.

This Chats Application (App) allows activities to be defined, and Chats [underline]#participants# to
 be booked for future activities. A key aspect of such participation is that some participant's 
 transportation to and from the activity needs to be arranged, the Chats App enables that
  administrative action.

An aspect of the Chats program is that some of the activities are regular. These are referred to as
 [underline]#recurring activities#. A participant booked against a recurring activity intends to 
 participate in the individual (actual) activies of that recurring activity.

Social engagement is also assisted by means of regular telephone calls to Chats participants. Chats 
[underline]#calls# are scheduled and then completed when a telephone call is made. Often these calls
 are made by a Chats [underline]#volunteer#.

There is also reporting functionality that the Chat App provides. 

[#Implementation]
== Implementation

This application has been developed for Lifeline Tasmania for data management in its 
https://www.lifeline.org.au/tasmania/chats-program[Chats] social engagement program. 

It is a application developed on the open-source http://isis.apache.org/[Apache Isis] Java 
web-application framework.

For installation details see <<Installation,below>>.

Version 2 of Chats App, based on a generic 
https://github.com/Stephen-Cameron-Data-Services/event-schedule[event-scheduling] app, 
is https://github.com/Stephen-Cameron-Data-Services/isis-chats/tree/chats2[available] but not as yet
in use.

[#ChatsAppBasics]
== Chats Application (App) Basics

The framework used to develop the Chats App is unusual in that it is auto-generates the user interface
from off the so-called 'domain model' design in Java object-oriented code. This sounds inflexible but
the thinking is that by improving the domain model this flows through to the user level. Once the 
distinctive features of how this happens are known it provides an efficient intuitive application for
users. So these are described now.

==== Main Menu Bar

The Chats App has a menu bar across the top with a single row of menu items.
Clicking on each of these gives a drop-down list of options each of which is described in sections 
below. These options in some cases are grouped into logical groupings via a dividing line.

On the left hand side of the menu bar is a small vertical bar (aqua blue in the following image). 
Clicking on this bar gives a list of bookmarks, which are links to entities that the user has prevously
visited in the current session.

The top-left 'Chats App' text is a hyperlink back to the 'home' page.

==== Page Body

Underneath the menu bar is the body of the page, where, usually, a specific Chats data 'entity' is 
displayed, each with an icon and title at the top, and then groups of data items and/or tables of 
child entities. Each such group and table also has a title at the top. The arrangement of items within
groups, and column orders within tables, is called the 'page layout'. The title of entities is commonly 
used for options lists of the kind of entity.

In searches, usually from a main menu option, a list is returned that fills the page body. Such lists may
be lists of entities, one per row, or, in the case of some reports each row represents a view across 
linked entities (e.g. Activity + Participant + Person + Attendance statistic).

==== Tabs

On some types of entities, tabs are used to aid navigation within an entity. The tab labels are 
diplayed as a row under the entity title, clicking on a tab label reveals a different subset of the
entities' data.
 
==== Navigation 

Navigation in Chats App is via links and icons (both are hyperlinks). A link is seen as underlined 
(light-blue) text. Specific icons are used to represent different kinds or 'types' of data entities so
providing a visual cue. Icon type hyperlinks are displayed on the left of all table rows to allow the
user to 'drill down' to get a full display of the child data entity (partially displayed in the row

==== Actions (buttons)

Another key concept in Chats App is that of [underline]#actions#. These are the grey 'buttons' that are
placed in relevant locations within the page layout. They usually have a small icon and a name to 
indicate their function. Hovering over an action button will display a message describing the action 
in more detail. Actions are the means for Chats App users to interact with an data entity.

==== Lists (collections)

Other than the use of distinctive icons for navigation into lists mentioned above, another key aspect of
lists is the action buttons that appear in the header bar of the list. 

The left-most (special) blue action button is always present and gives options to change the display of
the list. There are three standard display options: Table, Hide and Excel. Table is the standard view of
the list items, Hide simply removes the list items from view (Table brings them back), Excel presents
an action button 'Download as Excel' instead of the list, which if clicked then prompts to display or download 
the data as spreadsheet (.xlsx) file (just of what is in the table view so if not a complete enough export
 a custom action is needed).
 
 Other actions may be present and grey in colour. Add and Remove buttons are commonly present to add a new entity into 
 the list and remove an entry from the list.

=== Menu Option (Action) Descriptions

Descriptions of the menu options (actions) follow, with links to more detail.

[#ActivitiesMenu]
[#ActivitiesMenu_CreateRecurringActivity]
==== Activities -> Create Recurring Activity

To create a Recurring Activity the user is prompted to enter a name and a start date-time, optionally to enter a 
DEX Case Id. The name and start-date time are used to check for an existing activity with the same values in the database. 
The DEX Case Id will be created from the entered name if none is entered (by removing spaces and trimming to 25 characters).

The start date-time is not that of an actual activity, rather it is the seed date that is used for creation of the first 
'child' activity scheduled from the newly created parent recurring activity. 

The main reason to create a Recurring Activity parent is to maintain one list of Participants that gets shared with any child
activities scheduled off that parent. Each child's list of Participants includes those of its parent(<<RecurringActivity, more>>).

The region of the new Recurring Activity is the region assigned to the Chats App user.

[#ActivitiesMenu_CreateOneoffActivity]
==== Activities -> Create One-off Activity

To create a Recurring Activity the user is prompted to enter a name and a start date-time, optionally to enter a 
DEX Case Id. The name and start-date time are used to check for an existing activity with the same values in the database. 
The DEX Case Id will be created from the entered name if none is entered (by removing spaces and trimming to 25 characters).

The region of the new One-off Activity is the region assigned to the Chats App user.

[#<ActivitiesMenu_CreateOneoffActivity]
==== Activities -> Find Recurring Activity By Name

To find Recurring Activity 'parents' enter a name (or a partial name). This is a case sensitive search.  Only shows 
activities in the region of current Chats App user.

[#ActivitiesMenu_FindActivityByName]
==== Activities -> Find Activity By Name

To find activities enter a name (or partial name). This is a case sensitive search. The list returned will include all 
matching actual activities (i.e. One-off Activies (clear background icon) and Recurring Activity child activities
(yellow background icon)).  Only shows activities in the region of current Chats App user.

[#ActivitiesMenu_ListAllRecurringActivities]
==== Activities -> List All Recurring Activities

Generates a paged listing of all parent Recurring Activities for the region of the current Chats App user. 

[#ActivitiesMenu_ListAllFutureActivities]
==== Activities -> List All Future Activities

Generates a paged listing of all actual activities whose start date-time is later than the current date-time. Only 
shows such future activities in the region of the current Chats App user.

[#ActivitiesMenu_ListAllFutureActivitiesInPeriod]
==== Activities -> List All Future Activities In Period

Generates a paged listing of all actual activities whose start date-time lies within the Start and End date-times 
entered. Only shows the activities in the region of the current Chats App user.

[#ParticipantsMenu]
[#ParticipantsMenu_CreateParticipant]
==== Participants -> Create

To create a new Participant the user is prompted for the Chats Participant's first-name, surname, date-of-birth

[#ChatsDataEntities]
== Chats Data Entities

The following Chats data-model entities are described in sections below:

* <<Person, Persons>>
* <<Activity, Activities>>
** <<One-offActivity, One-off Activities>>
** <<RecurringActivity, Recurring Activities>>
* <<Participant, Participants>>
** <<Participation, Participation>>
** <<Attendance, Attendance>>
* <<Volunteer, Volunteers>>
** <<VolunteeredTime, Volunteered Time>>
* <<ChatsCall, Chats Calls>>

[#Person]
=== Persons

image:https://raw.github.com/Stephen-Cameron-Data-Services/isis-chats/master/dom/src/main/java/au/com/scds/chats/dom/general/Person.png[30,30] 
A Person entity in Chats App holds the contact details, address and some other items relating to a 
specific individual person. A new person is created automatically when a participant or volunteer is 
created. Validation checks are done to see if a person with the same identifying details is present and
if they are linked to an existing participant or volunteer.

The key personal details of firstname, surname, date-of-birth and sex, which are entered at the time of
creation of a new participant (or volunteer), are what are used to identify a unique person. The
contact details and address of the person are displayed and can be updated from their participant
record, along with the other data that is participant related. Other person data is needed but this
described in the <<Administration,Administration>> section.

[#Activity]
=== Activities

Activities are scheduled by Chats Administrators in the Chats App. There are two ways to create an 
Activity, either as a [underline]#One-off Activity# or by first creating a 
[underline]#Recurring Activity# as a 'parent' and then by scheduling 'child' activities off that parent.

When looking at a list of activities from a search, both the one-off and child activities are seen, as
they are basically the same, but have a slightly different icon the 'parented' activities having a 
yellow background 
image:https://raw.github.com/Stephen-Cameron-Data-Services/isis-chats/master/dom/src/main/java/au/com/scds/chats/dom/activity/ParentedActivityEvent.png[20,20]
 (more details below). A separate search for recurring activities is provided.

Activities have child [underline]#participations# and [underline]#attendances#, a participation is
essentially an intention to attend an activity (a 'booking') and an attendance is essentially actual
attendance by the participant at the activity. There are a few reasons for  separating these two, one
reason is that recurring activity parents and children have participations but only children have 
attendances.

[#One-offActivity]
==== One-off Activities 
image:https://raw.github.com/Stephen-Cameron-Data-Services/isis-chats/master/dom/src/main/java/au/com/scds/chats/dom/activity/ActivityEvent.png[30,30] 
These kinds of activities are the base kind, they are created from the 'Activities' menu option 
'Create One-off Activity'. 

Enter a name and a date-time - two mandatory properties. Optionally enter a dfferent DEX 'Case' ID
 (name) for DEX reporting purposes, if you don't one will be created from the mandatory name. DEX Case
  Id has a limit of 30??? characters, but the prompt allows 25.

[#RecurringActivity]
==== Recurring Activities
image:https://raw.github.com/Stephen-Cameron-Data-Services/isis-chats/master/dom/src/main/java/au/com/scds/chats/dom/activity/RecurringActivity.png[40,40] 
In the screen capture image below a 'Meet & Make' recurring activity is shown with the 'General' tab
content visible. There are four groups of data items with headings: 'General', 'Scheduling' 'Times'
and 'Location'. Where possible these groups are standardised between entities to aid familiarity.

[#Reports]
== Reports

Different Chats App report types are described under the <<ReportsMenu, Reports Menu>> section and its different report generation actions/options.

The monthly reporting to the DSS DEX upload site is described in the following Administration / <<DEXAdministration, DSS DEX monthly reporting>> section.

[#Administration]
== Administration

[#RegionnAdministration]
=== Regions

Regions are an important part of the Chats App. Most Chats data entities have an assigned region (SOUTH,
 NORTH, NORTH-WEST) and these values get used to control what data is visible to Chats App users.

The way this happens is through use of a security module installed as an extra "add-on" to the Apache 
Isis framework. Basically the framework determines a 'path' for each entity and compares that calculated
path (essentially the region's name) to a path defined for each App user in the security module. If 
there is a match then the user is allowed to see that entity. See the <<UserAdministration, Users and
Security>> section for more details.

[#PersonAdministration]
=== Persons

[#StatusAdministration]
=== Participant & Volunteer Status

[#UserAdministration]
=== Users and Security

The http://platform.incode.org/modules/spi/security/spi-security.html[Incode Security Module], an 
add-on module for Apache Isis, is used by Chats App. It allows control of Users, Roles and Permissions.
 Chats App also makes use of its 
 http://platform.incode.org/modules/spi/security/spi-security.html#_applicationtenancy_using_paths[Application Tenancy] via "paths" capability to restrict data visibility between Chats regions.

[#DEXAdministration]
=== DSS DEX monthly reporting

Generate XML file on a regional basis for uploading via DEX web portal.
Uploaded files can be rejected if contain invalid data, get an errors file link in response.
Upload file generation finds likely errors and gives a list instead of upload XML file.

==== Mapping Chats data to DEX 'Case', 'Client' and 'Session'

Case = Activity (via DEX Case Id)
Client = Participant (and volunteers via include as Participant)
Session = Activity or a Chats Call (on a day) event

==== Validating Chats data prior to report upload
