[[Person]]
== Person

The Chats App uses the combination of a Person's first-name, last-name (family-name) and date-of-birth to determine unique identity. So to create a new Person record successfully the combination of these three properties has to be different to any existing record in the system.

Note that the first and last name properties are case-sensitive, so there is an assumption (validate this?) that names will entered in proper-case (first letter upper-case, remainder lower-case).
