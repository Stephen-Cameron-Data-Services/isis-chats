[[Notes]]

== Notes

Notes are attachable to the several different kinds of entities in the following list.

* <<Participant, Participants>>
* <<Volunteer, Volunteers>>
* <<RecurringActivity, Recurring Activities>>
* <<ActivityEvent, Activities>>
* <<ScheduledCall, Calls>>

Notes are created from one of these 'notable' entities using a 'Create Note' button on that entity. 

A list of all notes created from such an entity is present on the entity itself.

There is a global list of Notes (currenty on the home page) and from each Note its possible to follow a link to its related 'notable' entity.

A more intelligent way of looking at notes or searching notes is needed. Anything type can be made 'notable' so the list above can be extended.

The key aspect of the Notes functionality is to be able to go from a Note in a general list of Notes back to its notable entity. That is, the place from which it was created.
